# discord-username-sniper
claims a username and discrim whenever its available.

# NOTE:
1. This might get your account locked or disabled, using an alt instead of main is recommended. <br />
2. You need to have a premium subscription ( nitro ) on your account <br />
3. It only snipes username and not discriminator, keep the discrim on your account before hand <br />
Example - if you wanna snipe xyz#0001, then set your discrim to 0001 and leave the username to any random string <br />
lastly this is a simple code to claim a username idk why i made this <br />
